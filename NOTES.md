# Notes

## Next steps / TBD

With more time, I would have addressed the following:

* CheckButtons: 
  * Fix limiter logic so buttons can be unselected
  * Inform user of limits
* Complete form validation
* Unit tests
* ProgressBar
* Step transitions: I would probably use a carousel type effect where stages slide left / right as the user goes forward / backward.
